          <p>I hope you have an amazing time there. Sorry I couldn't be there to surprise you ;) Though we've had a lot of fun together and a lot of memories. The most significant one is the rajathan trip. That's where the train started, right? ;) It was magical. It's been 2 years since then and it just doesn't feel so! Our morning walks, the random staring at you staring at random walls, the crazy desert safari and the amazing chai! </p>

          <p>From then on, it feels like an endless stream of happiness and joy. To all our times travelling, smiling, fighting, working and .....driving! <img class="img-small" src="img/cheers.png"> I miss going for random drives to the airport and back although you found it pointless to go there :P. For me, I think it saved a lot of time if we had to discuss where to go evrytime! ;)</p>

          <p>Sitting here, I feel handicapped for not being able to help you at times. I wish I was there for you all the time. But I hope this year, things fall in place and we get to be closer! </p>

          <p>I hope you have a lot of fun there today! I am sure birthdays are a big thing there! So you are still caught! :P  So one last time,</p>
