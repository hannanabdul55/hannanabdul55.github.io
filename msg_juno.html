            <p class="lead">Hello Aunty,</p>
            <p>
              You must be wondering why I'm writing to you now after all that's happened.
              All this while, I'm also wondering a lot of things.
              But one thing which was always in my mind was about how stressful it would be for you.
              For all this, I thought I owe atleast one message to you.
	      I've never been so remorseful about anything else in my life.<br><br>
 Before saying anything, I want to say that whatever happened between us and how it is now is all my fault.
 Keeping all the self blaming aside from both of us, the logical me always comes back to how I messed up.<br><br>
 I think Juno deserves better and I hope she does get the best from this world- both personally and professionally. And I know she will. Inshaallah. <br><br>
 All that's happened is the past and that it can't change. But the only thing I can do is to not make the same mistake again.
 I've learnt that the hard way. Most importantly, I want to seek forgiveness from you for all this.<br>
 Forgiveness from the fact that you trusted me so much and I broke it. It hurts for me to even think about it and it still does. I don't know what you went through but from just thinking about it, I know it is a lot. And all I can do is repent and make my best effort to become better from the mistakes I make. <br><br>
I guess the first thing that would have come to your mind is, "why now?".<br>
Last few months have just been terrible beyond my imagination.
I've literally lived the saying "as you sow, so shall you reap". And anyhow, it was just a matter of time that I come to this realization. I don't think anyone can be so lost for such a long time. <br>
I also haven't spoken about what happened between Juno and I because there's really no point now.
I really don't think I should spoil all my memories by thinking negatively about it all the time.<br>
I can't take the thought that I atleast never conveyed this to you.
I don't want to leave burnt bridges without atleast trying to rebuild it. Or atleast fix it.
I was lost aunty, lost in my mind. I am trying to get back on track and I'll never stop trying this now.
All I can wish now is some day, if not today, you accept my apology, Inshallah.
And I would never write this, unless it's a sincere one.
<br><br>
With all respect,<br>
Abdul Hannan
